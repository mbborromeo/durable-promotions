This is the front-end build of a hypothetical Marketing/Promotions page of a company's admin platform. Users will see a listing of the company's current promotions (from mock data), and when they click on the "Create Promotions" button they can create a: Google ad, Facebook post, Twitter tweet, and e-mail. This will be saved in localStorage, so next time the user views the webpage, the new promotions will still be visible.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
